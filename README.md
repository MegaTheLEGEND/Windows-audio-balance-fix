# Windows audio balance fix

For some reason, when I adjust my volume using my headphones encoder, the balance gets messed up. So I decided I would make this bandaid. I keep hearing about Grok AI, so I tried it and used it to throw this together in a few minutes. Not entirely sure what it will do on any other PC, but I used PyInstaller to make an EXE.
